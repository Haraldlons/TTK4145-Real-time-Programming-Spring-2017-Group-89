How to compile and run c-program.

install gcc and cygwin

with Cygwin64 Terminal it starts at a cygwin folder.
cd ../../cygdrive/c/Users/Harald/Desktop/TTK4145-Spring-2017-Group-89/

Compile a program
gcc yo.c -o yo
Then "yo.c" is the c file you want to compile and "yo.exe" will be the compiled executable program
Run program
./yo
Searches first in the current folder for the "yo.exe" file, and then runs it
